                We all write down how we think technology will evolve and publish the predictions at the end of 2031.
                I'm sure you will have a blast looking back at how expectations line up with reality.

                    Storing your digital contact details would be a pain.
                    Technology evolves, email addresses change and storing secret personal information would require adequate measures.
                    We don't want to commit to those responsibilities for a period of 10 years.

                    Why 2031 you ask? We all like round, easy to remember numbers.
                    10 year is such a nice number, thus 2031 was chosen because it is around 10 years from now.

                    We want to keep control and ensure nobody accidentally finds it, therefore we will be making copies and distributing it among people we trust.
                    Virtual copies will be stored in the cloud, on bare metal and offline (usb sticks).
                    Also everything will be printed and sealed in envelopes.

                    apply off-topic filtering. That's a problem to solve in november 2031 ;)

                    Anything that says something about how technology will be (or will change) in the future is on-topic.
                    Predictions about how society will interact with technology are considered on-topic as well, as long as the (changing) technology is she main subject.
                    Also, predictions are considered off-topic if they seem to be written with the intention to offend or use overly aggressive language.

                    The frontend is written in plain html, javascript and css without any fancy libraries because
                    I don't want to worry about keeping dependencies up to date for over a period of 10 years.
                    The site is served from an S3 bucket using CloudFront CDN.
                    The backend is a serverless application using Lambda an DynamoDB running on AWS.
