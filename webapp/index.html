            <p>Tech is evolving. Exciting, isn't it?<br/>
                To celebrate we are creating a <b>time capsule</b> packed with <b>tech-related predictions</b>.
                We all write down how we think technology will evolve and publish the predictions at the end of 2031.
                I'm sure you will have a blast looking back at how expectations line up with reality.

                    These predictions will be safely stored and kept secret.
                    In December 2031 all predictions will be made public for everyone to enjoy.

                    Storing your digital contact details would be a pain.
                    Technology evolves, email addresses change and storing secret personal information would require adequate measures.
                    I don't want to commit to those responsibilities for a period of 10 years.
                    That is why you are not able to submit your email address to a mailing list.<br/>

                    There won't be a classic metal-box burried at some classified location.
                    We want to keep control and ensure nobody accidentally finds it, therefore we will be making copies and distributing it among people we trust.
                    Virtual copies will be stored in the cloud, on bare metal and offline (usb sticks).
                    Also everything will be printed and sealed in envelops.

                    Assuming there will be a few hundred predictions, we will manually remove off-topic submissions.
                    In case many more predictions are entered we will have to reside to the technology of the future to
                    apply off-topic filtering. That's a problem to solve in november 2031 ;)

                    Anything that says something about how technology will be (or will change) in the future is on-topic.
                    Predictions about how society will interact with technology are considered on-topic as well, as long as the (changing) technology is she main subject.
                    Also, predictions are considered off-topic if they seem to be written with the intention to offend or use overly aggressive language.

                    The frontend is written in plain html, javascript and css without any fancy libraries because
                    I don't want to worry about keeping dependencies up to date for over a period of 10 years.
                    The site is served from an S3 bucket using CloudFront CDN.
                    The backend is a serverless application using Lambda an DynamoDB running on AWS.
